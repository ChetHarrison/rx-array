### rx-array

Adds the Map/Reduce functions to the Array prototype so you can play with this style. Once your comfortable with this kind of style in a synchronous collection such as an Array.

Map/Reduce is your friend when you need to pull deeply nested targets out of a large amount of JSON. I highly recomend you spend a little time with [this excellent tutorial](http://reactive-extensions.github.io/learnrx/) from Jafar Husain of Netflix **Note: Do it in Chrome. It doesn't work in Firefox.**
